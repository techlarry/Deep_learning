It allows you to interleave operation which build a `computation graph` with ones that run the graph.

    "\n",
    "To do efficient numerical computing in Python, we typically use libraries like `NumPy` that do expensive operations such as matrix multiplication outside Python, using highly efficient code implemented in another language. Unfortunately, there can still be a lot of overhead from switching back to Python every operation. This overhead is especially bad if you want to run computations on GPUs or in a distributed manner, where there can be a high cost to transferring data.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow also does its heavy lifting outside Python, but it takes things a step further to avoid this overhead. Instead of running a single expensive operation independently from Python, TensorFlow lets us describe a graph of interacting operations that run entirely outside Python. This approach is similar to that used in `Theano` or `Torch`.\n",
